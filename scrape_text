These milestone achievements, combined with our promising product pipeline and strong financial flexibility, provide a solid foundation that will enable us to deliver sustained growth and long-term benefits for our patients.” First Quarter $ amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 Change Total Revenues $11,648 $11,073 5 % Earnings Per Share - GAAP* 0.59 0.89 (34) % Earnings Per Share - Non-GAAP* 1.96 1.74 13 % *    In the first quarter of 2022, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share include a net impact of ($0.10) per share due to Acquired IPRD charges that were partially offset by licensing income FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS All comparisons are made versus the same period in 2021 unless otherwise stated. • Bristol Myers Squibb posted first quarter revenues of $11.6 billion, an increase of 5%, driven by in-line products (primarily Eliquis and Opdivo ) and new product portfolio (primarily cell therapy products and Reblozyl ), partially offset by Recent LOE Products ( Revlimid and Abraxane ) and foreign exchange impacts. • U.S. revenues increased 10% to $7.7 billion in the quarter. International revenues decreased 3% to $4.0 billion in the quarter. When adjusted for foreign exchange impact, international revenues increased 3%, driven by in-line products (primarily Eliquis and Opdivo ). • Gross margin increased from 74.3% to 78.8% in the quarter primarily due to an impairment charge related to marketed product rights in the same period of last year and foreign exchange. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin increased from 78.1% to 79.2% in the quarter primarily driven by foreign exchange. • Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 10% to $1.8 billion in the quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis primarily due to differences of timing of spend compared to the prior year as well as investments in our product portfolio. • Research and development expenses increased 2% to $2.3 billion in the quarter primarily due to an in-process research and development (“IPRD”) impairment charge, partially offset by timing of spend. On a non-GAAP basis, research and development expenses decreased 4% to $2.1 billion in the quarter primarily due to timing of spend compared to the prior year. 2 • Acquired IPRD increased to $333 million in the quarter primarily due to up-front and milestone charges relating to the Dragonfly and Immatics licensing arrangements. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased 4% to $2.4 billion in the quarter primarily due to a longer than previously expected market exclusivity period for Pomalyst. • The GAAP effective tax rate changed from 19.8% to 23.9% in the quarter primarily due to the non-taxable contingent value rights related income in the prior period. The non-GAAP effective tax rate changed from 16.8% to 15.9% in the quarter primarily due to jurisdictional earnings mix. • The company reported net earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $1.3 billion, or $0.59 per share, in the first quarter, compared to $2.0 billion, or $0.89 per share, for the same period a year ago. In addition to the items discussed above, the results include the impact of fair value adjustments on equity investments and contingent value rights in both periods. • The company reported non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Bristol Myers Squibb of $4.2 billion, or $1.96 per share, in the first quarter, compared to non-GAAP net earnings of $4.0 billion, or $1.74 per share, for the same period a year ago. In addition to the items discussed above, the results in the current period included the impact of lower weighted-average common shares outstanding. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, significant R&D charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights are no longer excluded from non-GAAP results. These R&D charges that were previously specified are now presented in a new financial statement line item labeled Acquired IPRD. In the first quarter of 2022, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share include a net impact of ($0.10) per share due to Acquired IPRD charges that were partially offset by licensing income. For purposes of comparability, the non-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of 2021 have been updated to reflect this change. A discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures is included under the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information” section. 3 FIRST QUARTER PRODUCT REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS $ amounts in millions Product Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 % Change from Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 % Change from Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 (Excl.

REVENUE HIGHLIGHTS In-Line Products Revenues for in-line products in the first quarter were $8.3 billion compared to $7.7 billion in the prior year period, representing an increase of 8%. In-line products revenue was largely driven by: • Eliquis revenues, which grew 11% compared to the prior year period. U.S. revenues were $2.1 billion compared to $1.9 billion in the prior year period, representing an increase of 4 12% driven by higher volume. International revenues were $1.1 billion compared to $963 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of 10% driven by higher demand, partially offset by foreign exchange. • Opdivo revenues increased 12% compared to the prior year period. U.S. revenues were $1.1 billion compared to $944 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of 16% driven by higher demand across multiple indications including the Opdivo+Yervoy based combinations for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Opdivo+Cabometyx ® combination for kidney cancer, and Opdivo -based therapies for various gastric and esophageal cancers, partially offset by declining second-line eligibility across tumor and increased competition. International revenues were $824 million compared to $776 million, representing an increase of 6% driven by higher demand as a result of launches for additional indications and core indications, partially offset by foreign exchange. New Product Portfolio New product portfolio revenues grew to $350 million compared to $161 million to the prior year period, driven by higher demand primarily relating to Abecma , Breyanzi and Reblozyl . Recent LOE Products • Revlimid revenues declined by 5% compared to the prior year period. U.S. revenues increased 4% to $2.0 billion as compared to the prior year period driven by higher volume. International revenues were $759 million compared to $986 million in the prior year period, representing a decrease of 23% driven by generic erosion across several EU countries and Canada and foreign exchange. • Abraxane revenues declined 32% compared to the prior year period. U.S. revenues were $173 million compared to $225 million in the prior year period, representing a 23% decline driven by lower demand, primarily due to manufacturing delays. PRODUCT AND PIPELINE UPDATE Cardiovascular 5 Category Asset Milestone Regulatory Camzyos TM The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approved Camzyos TM (mavacamten) for the treatment of adults with symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (obstructive HCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms. Camzyos is the first and only FDA-approved allosteric and reversible inhibitor selective for cardiac myosin that targets the underlying pathophysiology of obstructive HCM. The approval was based on the Phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM trial. Clinical & Research Camzyos Interim results from the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of the MAVA-LTE trial showed sustained improvements in cardiovascular outcomes at 48 and 84 weeks among patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) who were treated with Camzyos . Results from the Phase 3 VALOR-HCM trial showed that the study met its primary and secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the need for septal reduction therapy (SRT) in patients with severely symptomatic oHCM who had been appropriate for SRT per the 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines at baseline, after 16 weeks of treatment with Camzyos . Oncology Category Asset Milestone Regulatory Opdivo ® (nivolumab) The European Commission (EC) approved Opdivo in combination with Yervoy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with tumor cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. The EC also approved Opdivo in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based chemotherapy for the same indication. The approvals were based on data from the Phase 3 CheckMate -648 trial. The EC approved Opdivo for the adjuvant treatment of adults with high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, based on the Phase 3 CheckMate -274 trial. Opdivo is the first immunotherapy approved for these patients. The FDA approved Opdivo 360 mg (injection for intravenous use) in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the neoadjuvant setting, based on the Phase 3 CheckMate -816 trial. This marks the first immunotherapy-based treatment approved in this setting. An application for this indication was also validated by the European Medicines Agency. Opdualag TM (nivolumab and relatlimab-rmbw) The FDA approved Opdualag , a new, first-in-class, fixed-dose combination of nivolumab and relatlimab, a novel LAG-3 inhibitor, for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age or older with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, based on the Phase 2/3 RELATIVITY-047 trial. 6 Category Asset Milestone Clinical & Research Opdivo Results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -816 trial showed that neoadjuvant treatment with Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy significantly improved event-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone in patients with resectable NSCLC. Two-year follow-up results from the Phase 3 CheckMate -9ER trial demonstrated sustained survival, response rate benefits and health-related quality of life improvements with Opdivo combined with cabozantinib versus sunitinib in the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. bempegaldesleu-kin Phase 3 PIVOT IO-001 trial did not meet its primary endpoints of progression-free survival and objective response rate in patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were treated with bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. The trial was conducted in collaboration with Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR). Based upon subsequent results from pre-planned analyses of two late-stage clinical studies in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder cancer, coupled with the results of the PIVOT IO-001 trial in metastatic melanoma, BMS and Nektar have jointly decided to end the global clinical development program for bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo. Hematology Category Asset Milestone Regulatory Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel) The EC approved Breyanzi for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The approval is based on results from the TRANSCEND WORLD and TRANSCEND NHL 001 trials. The FDA accepted for priority review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand its current indication to include earlier use of Breyanzi for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after failure of first-line therapy. The FDA assigned a PDUFA goal date of June 24, 2022. The sBLA is based on results from the Phase III TRANSFORM trial. Reblozyl® (luspatercept-aamt) The FDA extended the review of the sBLA for Reblozyl for the treatment of anemia in adults with non-transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia to June 27, 2022. The sBLA is based on results from the Phase 2 BEYOND trial. 7 Immunology Category Asset Milestone Clinical & Research Zeposia ® (ozanimod) Interim results from the Phase 3 True North open-label extension trial demonstrated that the percentage of patients achieving clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic improvement and corticosteroid-free remission was maintained through Week 142 for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who were treated with Zeposia . Capital Allocation The company continues to maintain a consistent, balanced approach to capital allocation focused on prioritizing investments for growth through business development along with reducing debt, commitment to dividend growth and share repurchase. • The Company extended the maturities of certain long-term debt (i) with the purchase of $6.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in March and April through tender offers and “make whole” redemptions and (ii) the issuance of $6.0 billion of additional senior unsecured notes maturing between 2032 and 2062. • In February, the company entered into accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transactions to repurchase $5 billion of Bristol Myers Squibb common stock. The company anticipates that these ASR transactions will be settled during the second and third quarters of 2022.( link ) Financial Guidance Bristol Myers Squibb is adjusting its 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP line-item guidance as follows: Guidance for Total Net Sales, Revlimid Sales and Recent LOE Sales, is being adjusted due to foreign exchange and faster erosion of Revlimid in International markets. The Company is also adjusting operating expenses due to foreign exchange as well as cost discipline. GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share include the net impact of Acquired IPRD & licensing income due to ($0.10) incurred in Q1 and an additional ($0.11) due to the buyout of a future royalty obligation related to mavacamten that occurred in April 2022.  Excluding these adjustments, the outlook for non-GAAP EPS is unchanged. Key 2022 GAAP and non-GAAP line-item guidance assumptions are: 8 U.S. GAAP Non-GAAP February (Prior) April (Revised) February (Prior) April (Revised) Total Net Sales ~$47.0 billion or low single-digit increase In-line with 2021 ~$47.0 billion or low single-digit increase In-line with 2021 Recent LOE Products 1 ~$10.5 billion or double-digit decline ~$10.0 billion or double-digit decline ~$10.5 billion or double-digit decline ~$10.0 billion or double-digit decline Revlimid $9.5-$10 billion $9.0-$9.5 billion $9.5-$10 billion $9.0-$9.5 billion In-line Products & New Product Portfolio ~$36.5 billion or Low double- digit increase No Change ~$36.5 billion or Low double- digit increase No Change Gross Margin % ~78% No Change ~78% No Change Operating Expenses 2 Approx. 10% decline Mid single-digit decline In-line with 2021 Low single-digit decline Tax Rate ~24% ~22% ~16.5% No Change Diluted EPS $3.37 - $3.67 $2.92 - $3.22 $7.65 - $7.95 $7.44 - $7.74 3 1 Recent LOE Products = Revlimid and Abraxane 2 Operating Expenses = MS&A and R&D, excluding IPRD and Amortization of acquired intangibles 3 Inclusive of net impact of ($0.21) of acquired IPRD and licensing income The 2022 financial guidance excludes the impact of any potential future strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and any specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified and impact of future Acquired IPRD.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In discussing financial results and guidance, the company refers to financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The non-GAAP financial measures are provided as supplemental information to the financial measures presented in this press release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and are presented because management has evaluated the company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented portray the results of the company's baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of the company’s underlying financial performance and trends and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin, which is gross profit excluding certain specified items as a percentage of revenues, non-GAAP operating expenses, which is marketing, selling and administrative and research and development expenses excluding certain specified items, non-GAAP marketing, selling and administrative expenses, which is marketing, selling and administrative expense excluding certain specified items, and non-GAAP research and development expenses, which is research and development expenses excluding certain specified items, are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results. This earnings release and the accompanying tables also provide certain revenues and expenses as well as non-GAAP measures excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. 10 Non-GAAP financial measures such as non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the company’s business nor reflect the company’s underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, divestiture gains or losses, stock compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of Celgene awards, certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the Celgene transaction, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments) and amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items.  Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, significant R&D charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights are no longer excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. We are making these changes to our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures following comments from and discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For purposes of comparability, the non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended March 31, 2021 have been updated to reflect this change. Because the non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures presented in the press release that are prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are provided in the accompanying financial tables and also available on the company’s website at www.bms.com. Within the attached financial tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.
